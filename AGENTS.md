# rebalancer_pro — Living Reference

## What this is
A portfolio rebalancer and daily review agent for Paytm Money and Zerodha Kite.
Runs on a Mac (launchd), sends a Slack summary daily, and supports interactive
rebalancing via CLI.

Push target: **always `git push rebalancer master`** — never push to `origin` (upstream paytmmoney/pyPMClient).

## Deploy pipeline
`feature/<taskID-goal>` → `develop` → `master`. A merge only goes **live** via
`scripts/deploy.py` (the `deploy` skill) — restarting the persistent webhook, not just
merging (the gap that caused stale data):
- `python scripts/deploy.py dev` — preview `develop` on a second webhook at
  `127.0.0.1:5002` (a `develop` git worktree) → **`dashboard_pp`**, **local-only** (the
  tunnel targets :5001; `/dashboard_pp` 404s any request carrying Cloudflare headers).
- `python scripts/deploy.py prod` — pull `master`, restart the production webhook
  (`:5001`), refresh snapshots, verify **`dashboard_main`** (public via relay+Access).
Flow per task: merge feature→develop → `deploy dev` → Pradeep reviews `dashboard_pp` →
merge develop→master → `deploy prod`.

**Enforced:** `.github/workflows/pr-flow.yml` (via `scripts/check_pr_flow.py`) fails any
PR that skips the flow — `feature/*` must target `develop`, `develop` targets `master`.
A feature branch cannot merge straight to master.

**No follow-up pushes to a merged PR.** Once a PR is opened, get it right in one push
and only say "final — safe to merge" when the last commit is up and CI is green; in an
authorised flow, merge it yourself immediately to close the race. If a fix is needed
*after* a PR merged, it is a **new branch off develop**, never a push to the old branch —
that push would orphan the commit (it never reaches develop/master). Enforced by the
pre-push guard `scripts/check_branch_not_merged.py` (gate 0): it blocks a push to any
branch whose PR is already merged.

## Scheduled jobs

| Job | Schedule (IST) | Schedule (UTC) | Entry point | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Paytm Money daily review | 7:45 AM IST | 02:15 UTC | `python -m agent.daily_review --broker paytm` | Writes `mydata/paytm_suggestions.txt` + Slack |
| Zerodha daily review | 8:00 AM IST | 02:30 UTC | `python -m agent.daily_review --broker zerodha` | Zerodha tokens reset ~3:30 AM; headless auth link posted to Slack |
| Dashboard ping + refresh | 7:50 AM, 12:00 PM, 3:00 PM IST | — | `python -m agent.dashboard_ping` | Refreshes Paytm/Zerodha encrypted dashboard snapshots, then posts compact Slack link |
| Hourly health check | every hour | — | `python -m agent.sanity_check` | Auto-fixes infra/code failures via `claude -p`, **auto-merges to master after a green test suite**, posts the merged PR to Slack. 6h cooldown. Read-only status: `--report`. |
| Token handoff monitor | every 10 min | — | `python -m agent.token_monitor` | Estimates rolling-5h Claude usage from the session logs; at ≥88% hands the active task to Codex (HANDOFF.md + Slack), hands back when Claude refreshes. `--report` for read-only status. The % is an **estimate** — calibrate `CLAUDE_5H_TOKEN_BUDGET`. |

Scheduled via macOS **launchd** (`~/Library/LaunchAgents/`). Wrap each command in `try/except`; prefix logs with `[cron]`.

**Sanity-check auto-merge (project opt-in):** the hourly health check is allowed to
**merge its own fix to master** — but ONLY when (a) the failure is an auto-fixable
infra/code check, and (b) the deterministic suite (`pytest -m "not live"`) passes
first. This keeps the app self-healing without waiting on a manual merge. It does
**not** extend to regular/feature work, which always goes via PR for review. Every
auto-merge is announced on Slack with the PR link so it can be reviewed/reverted.

## External services

| Service | Purpose | Docs |
|---|---|---|
| Paytm Money API | Portfolio data, order placement | pmClient SDK (this repo) |
| Zerodha Kite Connect | Equity/MF holdings, SIPs | `kiteconnect` PyPI package |
| Slack | Daily summary + alert delivery (incoming webhook) | `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` |
| Cloudflare Tunnel | Expose local webhook over public HTTPS | `tunnel_manager.py` |

---

## Test helpers

| Script | What it verifies |
|---|---|
| `scripts/verify_<feature>.py` | Feature-specific verification — saves `testplans/<date>/results.json`; exits `sys.exit(2)` on failure |

Every task delivery ends with: **verified / not-verified / known-issues** stated explicitly.

## Working conventions

**Task tracking is mandatory and total.** `task.md` is the single ledger for
**every change to this repo — code, config, or infra — and every piece of work
either Pradeep or an agent (Claude/Codex) recommends.** No exceptions: a Slack
migration, a one-line fix, a launchd tweak, a doc edit — each gets a `task.md`
entry **before the work starts**, not at commit time.
- **Precise, low-temperature context.** Entries state facts, not fluff: real
  file names, real values traced to source, the actual Done-check. No invented
  numbers, no vague goals.
- **Rigorous tests per task, no loopholes.** Every task's Done-check names a
  concrete test/verification; edge cases are covered, not just the happy path.
- **Self-initiated work counts.** When work starts mid-conversation (not via a
  filed request), still open the `task.md` entry first — this is the gap the
  guard below closes.
- Template fields: Date, Status, Task, Goal, Constraints, Inputs, Outputs,
  Done-check, Out-of-scope. Task numbering: `<NN>-<DDMMYY>`, `NN` resets to `01`
  the first task each new day.
- Lifecycle: complete → `Status: complete <date> — <result>` (kept visible or
  commented per the template); parked → `Status: pending — parked <date>`.
- At the start of each session, show the current `task.md` state for review.

**Enforced at push time.** `scripts/check_task_tracked.py` (wired into the
pre-push hook) blocks a push whose branch doesn't map to a documented `task.md`
task id (`feature/<NN-DDMMYY>-<slug>` → a real `Task: <id>` entry). Fix by adding
the entry; `git push --no-verify` overrides only in a genuine emergency.

**`action_items.md` — explicit manual-only residue.** ONLY tasks an agent
**genuinely cannot do in any case** go here: a broker login Pradeep must tap, a
domain he must purchase, a secret he must enter, a dashboard setting only he can
change. Everything an agent *can* do — including config and infra edits — is a
`task.md` task, not an action item. Typing `ledger` shows the open items; `jarvis`
runs the active `task.md` task.

**Push** — never push automatically. Always add a push item to `action_items.md` and remind Pradeep to run `git push rebalancer master`.

**Code conventions**
- **Notifications** — `notify()` (Slack) must never block the main flow. In scheduled jobs, wrap in `threading.Thread(target=notify, args=(msg,), daemon=True).start()` if needed. It confirms delivery (HTTP 200 `ok`) — never assume a send succeeded without that.
- **Input validation** — at webhook/CLI boundaries: validate → normalize → act. OAuth callback tokens are format-checked before use.
- **Scheduled jobs** — all jobs wrapped in `try/except Exception as e: print(f"[cron] {e}")`. IST→UTC conversion documented as a comment on every schedule expression.
- **Secrets** — never log or print env var values. `.env` is gitignored.
- **pmClient** — treat as read-only upstream. All agent logic lives in `agent/`.

## Cross-agent collaboration (Claude + Codex)

This repo is worked by **both** Claude (`CLAUDE.md`, `.claude/skills/`) and Codex
(`AGENTS.md`, `.agents/skills/`); they hand work off to each other. Keep the two
sides in sync so whichever agent picks up the work inherits the full context:

- **`AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` are the same living reference** — update both together.
- **`.claude/skills/` and `.agents/skills/` hold the identical skill set:**
  `jarvis`, `ledger`, `monitor`, `no-slop`, `review-gate`, `verify-change`,
  `add-scheduled-job`. A new skill is added to **both** dirs in the same change.
- When either agent resumes the other's work, it applies the **same conventions** —
  the no-slop pre-push review, the review-gate, `task.md`/`action_items.md` tracking,
  the branch→PR→merge flow, and the sanity-check auto-merge opt-in.
- The scheduled auto-fixer (`sanity_check`) invokes the `claude -p` CLI; either agent
  may be used for interactive/handoff work.
